	I believe Analysis Text A to be the written notes for, or transcription of, an Ancient
	Roman Philosopher's speech about the nature of the Heavens written at the start of the 
	fall of the Roman Republic. I arrived at this conclusion incrementally, collection more
	information with repeated analyses. First I  established a likely time period based on 
	connections made and language used within the piece and generated several possibilities
	based on the time period and structure of the piece, then I gradually eliminated scenarios
	using the structure of Analysis Text A and my existing knowledge.
