1. Implementation of three screen-space special effects.
	1.1 [ 2.0 ] First screen-space effect works reasonably well (the result looks
	reasonable and fits the description of the chosen effect).
	1.2 [ 2.0 ] Second screen-space effect works reasonably well.
	1.3 [ 2.0 ] Third screen-space effect works reasonably well.
	
		A. A horizontal wipe, where the screen turns (say) blue beginning from the left and progressing to the right. 
			When the wipe is done, the screen should remain blue for about 1 second and then return to normal.
		
		B. Show a 2X2 tiling of the scene over the image plane.
		
		C. Make a "shockwave" effect, where some distortion begins at a point and spreads outward; 
			once the shockwave has passed, the scene should look normal again.
		
		D. Make a strong blur effect. (Suggestion: average at least 25 texture reads. Use a "for loop" or nested "for loops".)
		
		E. Make a "swirl" effect where the scene spins around the center in a distorted way.
		
		F. Create a fog effect, where the player seems to be immersed in a cloud.
		
		G. Create a bloom effect, where a pixel takes the value of the brightest pixel nearby.
		
		H. Invent your own effect or implement an effect you have seen in a game. Use your imagination. 
			Very simple effects or effects very similar to thoseq seen in class will not count to get very good marks.

	Note: for effect H “Invent your own effect or implement an effect you have seen
	in a game”, you should be able to describe what the effect does or what it is
	trying to simulate. The description should make it clear that the effect is not just a
	random modification of pixels.

2. Fireworks particle system.
	2.1 [ 0.5 ] Particles start with a spherical velocity distribution.
	2.2 [ 0.5 ] Particles fall under gravity.
	2.3 [ 0.5 ] Explosions have different colors.
	2.4 [ 0.5 ] Explosions go on continuously and happen at different times. At least 3
					explosions on screen at any given time.
					
		Create a simple "fireworks" particle system in which, for each explosion, 
		particles start with a spherical velocity distribution and then fall under gravity. 
		This means you can directly compute each particle's position from its initial position, velocity, and time: x(t) = x(0) + v*t + 0.5*g*t*t. 
		Have at least 3 explosions onscreen at any given time. Give the explosions different colours, as well as (obviously) positions and times. 
		New explosions should appear to replace completed ones (it is an ongoing fireworks show).
					
3. Particle system resembling a rocket exhaust.
	3.1 [ 1.0 ] The particle system looks like a rocket exhaust. The particles spread out
	in a cone or lobe shape.
	3.2 [ 0.5 ] Particle phase is used to make the spray continuous.
	3.3 [ 0.5 ] Interesting color distribution.

Bonus 1. [ 1.0 ] A “ring” style explosion.

Bonus 2. Fog effect using depth of pixels.
	Bonus 2.1 [ 0.5 ] Depth values are read from the depth buffer.
	Bonus 2.2 [ 0.5 ] Depth values are used to control the amount of fog added to a
						pixel.
						
Total: 10 points + 2 bonus.
