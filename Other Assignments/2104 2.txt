A
	Zodiac Iconography surrounding central figure
		Eastern influence		
		
	4 figures in corners:
		Two bearded, two clean shaven, all male.
			BR = Young Boy (Weak Chin)
			TR = Young Man (Strong Chin)
			TL = Officially Man (Beard, few wrinkles)
			BL = Old Man (firmer wrinkles, from what I can see he appears less in shape)
			
		Cycle of Life and Rebirth, young to old.
	
	Central Figure: 
		Winged Man/Angel
		Standing on burning platform
			Appears to be more fire above his head. Sun?
		Snake head on top
			Body appears to be coiled around him
		Holding staff
		Lion's Head in center of chest
		Head appears wreathed, Laurel?
		In one hand a staff or pole, in the other, a set of intertwined sticks or cord or somethin
		
	I believe this is meant to link together images of an Angel and Sol Invictus, connecting Christian/Jewish Iconography with Sol Invictus
	
B
	Zodiac Iconography surrounding central figure
		Eastern influence		
	4 figures in corners
		All appear winged. Three have layered black and white, one is fully dark.
			Seasons? 
				TL=Spring(Chicken depicted eating plant, Chickens are effective at spreading seed.), 
				TR=Winter(Dark Wings indicative of shorter days), 
				BL=Fall(Food iconography -> Harvest),
				BR=Summer(Sun sash looking thing)
			Cycle of Rebirth in natural world
		
	Central Figure == Inconquerable Sun. (Chariot + 4 horses. Sun Hat. Travelling across sky, followed by night)
		Therefore must be after the appearance of Sol Invictus.
		
	Zodiac Aligned with Figures Representing seasons, approximation of calendar.
	This mosaic depicts Sol Invictus at the center of everything, and illustrates his importance. 
		Sol Invictus as the most important because it is by him that plants can grow, and that the year goes around.
