1. Implement Phong shading in the pixel shader.
1.1 [ 1.0 ] The reflection vector is computed in the correct manner.
1.2 [ 1.0 ] The specular component is implemented according to the Phong
(dot(V, R)) model.

2. Add a second light to the scene.
2.1 [ 1.0 ] The light is directional.
2.2 [ 1.0 ] The calculations for the second light are correct, and the new light is
added to the existing light.

3. Texturing of the cannon.
3.1 [ 1.5 ] The code defines texture coordinates during the creation of the
meshes, and the textures are parametrized onto the shapes in a reasonable
manner.
3.2 [ 0.5 ] Texturing uses at least two different images. The two images can be
combined into a single image file, if selected with appropriate texture coordinates.

4. Combine an illumination model with textures.
4.1 [ 1.0 ] The pixel retrieved from the texture is combined with the illumination
model in a reasonable manner, i.e., at least the diffuse term uses the pixel value.

5. Implement toon shading.
5.1 [ 2.0 ] Toon shading implemented according to a ramp or discrete set of colors
and chosen according to both diffuse and specular lighting components.
5.2 [ 1.0 ] An outline is added to the toon shading and a background other than
black is used in the demo.

6. Bonus: checkerboard pattern.
6.1 [ 0.75 ] A shader draws a checkerboard pattern around a cylinder.
6.2 [ 0.25 ] The pattern is combined with the illumination model.
